# Unmasking Crime Patterns in Los Angeles: A Data Journey from SQL to Power BI

## Executive Summary
This project provides an in-depth analysis of crime trends in Los Angeles from 2020 to 2024. By extracting, cleaning, and transforming crime data using SQL Server and visualizing it in Power BI, I uncovered key trends related to victim demographics, crime concentration by area, and temporal shifts. The interactive dashboards highlight significant changes over timeâ€”such as shifts in hotspot areas and variations across victim sex, age, and ethnicity. The analysis not only showcases technical proficiency in SQL, Power BI, and DAX, but also translates complex data into actionable insights. I recommend further investigation into emerging trends to support targeted public safety initiatives.

## Business Problem
Law enforcement agencies face the challenge of efficiently allocating resources and developing targeted crime prevention strategies. Understanding how crime affects different demographic groups is crucial for:
- Developing effective prevention programs
- Allocating patrol resources efficiently
- Identifying vulnerable populations
- Creating targeted community outreach initiatives
The current analysis aims to provide data-driven insights to support these objectives by examining crime patterns across gender, age, and ethnicity dimensions.

## Methodology
The analysis followed a structured approach:
1. Data Extraction and Cleaning: Developed complex SQL queries in SQL Server to clean and standardize demographic data, creating consistent categories for analysis.
2. Data Transformation: Created SQL views for temporal and demographic analysis for import them on Power BI.
3. Visualization & Analysis: I built an interactive Power BI report with multiple pages (Overview, Trends, Victim Sex, Victim Age, Victim Ethnicity) to explore temporal trends and geographic hotspots, excluding incomplete Q4 data for 2024 to maintain analysis integrity.

## Skills
This project leverages a diverse set of technical skills and tools, including:
- SQL Server: Data extraction, cleaning, and transformation using T-SQL, CTEs, and stored procedures.
- Power BI: Interactive dashboard creation with data modeling, DAX calculations, and advanced visualizations.
- Data Visualization: Design of charts, heatmaps, slopegraphs, and bar charts to effectively communicate insights.
- Analytical Thinking: Integrating business context into data analysis to deliver actionable recommendations.

## Results & Business Recommendation
Key findings from the analysis include:
- Shifting Hotspots: Significant changes in crime concentration, with certain areas showing a notable shift in crime rates over time.
- Demographic Insights: Variations in crime rates by victim sex, age, and ethnicity indicate targeted patterns, such as a substantial increase in crimes among the 'Unknown' category and converging trends in specific geographic areas.
- Temporal Trends: Exclusion of incomplete Q4 data for 2024 provided a more accurate representation of trends, highlighting quarterly shifts and yearly evolution.

Recommendations:
- Resource Allocation: Focus additional patrols in areas showing higher crime rates for specific demographic groups.
- Prevention Programs: Develop targeted safety awareness programs for identified vulnerable populations.
- Community Outreach: Establish specialized outreach initiatives for most affected demographic groups.
- Monitoring System: Implement quarterly reviews of demographic patterns to adjust strategies proactively.
